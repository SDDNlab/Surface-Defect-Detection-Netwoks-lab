# Introduction

---

We have collected in this folder the current anomaly detection models implemented based on unsupervised learning. The main objective of this project is to promote the practical application of unsupervised learning-based anomaly detection algorithms.

## Guidance

---

- The public collection of unsupervised deep learning anomaly detection algorithms.
- A set of inference tools for quick and easy deployment of the standard anomaly detection models.
- This contains both [PyTorch models](https://pytorch.org/) and [TensorFlow models](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=zh-cn).

# Getting Started

---

where the currently available models are:

- [AnoGAN-tf](https://github.com/LeeDoYup/AnoGAN-tf)
- [GANomaly](https://github.com/samet-akcay/ganomaly)
- [Skip-GANomaly](https://github.com/samet-akcay/skip-ganomaly)
- [Skip-Attention-GAN](https://github.com/SYLan2019/Skip-Attention-GAN)
